       "'\\na man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern alabama, looking down\\ninto the swift water twenty feet below.  the man\\'s hands were behind\\nhis back, the wrists bound with a cord.  a rope closely encircled his\\nneck.  it was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the\\nslack fell to the level of his knees.  some loose boards laid upon the\\nties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him\\nand his executioners--two private soldiers of the federal army,\\ndirected by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy\\nsheriff.  at a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an\\nofficer in the uniform of his rank, armed.  he was a captain.  a\\nsentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the\\nposition known as \"support,\" that is to say, vertical in front of the\\nleft shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight\\nacross the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect\\ncarriage of the body.  it did not appear to be the duty of these two\\nmen to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they\\nmerely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.\\n\\nbeyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\\nstraight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was\\nlost to view.  doubtless there was an outpost farther along.  the\\nother bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle slope topped with\\na stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a\\nsingle embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon\\ncommanding the bridge.  midway up the slope between the bridge and\\nfort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at\\n\"parade rest,\" the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels\\ninclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands\\ncrossed upon the stock. a lieutenant stood at the right of the line,\\nthe point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his\\nright.  excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a\\nman moved.  the company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless.\\nthe sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues\\nto adorn the bridge.  the captain stood with folded arms, silent,\\nobserving the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. death is a\\ndignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal\\nmanifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him.  in\\nthe code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of\\ndeference.\\n\\nthe man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about\\nthirty-five years of age.  he was a civilian, if one might judge from\\nhis habit, which was that of a planter.  his features were good--a\\nstraight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark\\nhair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar\\nof his well fitting frock coat.  he wore a moustache and pointed\\nbeard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a\\nkindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose\\nneck was in the hemp.  evidently this was no vulgar assassin.  the\\nliberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of\\npersons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\\n\\nthe preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped\\naside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing.\\nthe sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself\\nimmediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace.\\nthese movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on\\nthe two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties\\nof the bridge.  the end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not\\nquite, reached a fourth.  this plank had been held in place by the\\nweight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.  at a\\nsignal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would\\ntilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.  the arrangement\\ncommended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.  his face\\nhad not been covered nor his eyes bandaged.  he looked a moment at his\\n\"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water\\nof the stream racing madly beneath his feet. a piece of dancing\\ndriftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the\\ncurrent.  how slowly it appeared to move!  what a sluggish stream!\\n\\nhe closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\\nchildren.  the water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding\\nmists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\\nsoldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him.  and now he\\nbecame conscious of a new disturbance.  striking through the thought\\nof his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor\\nunderstand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of\\na blacksmith\\'s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.\\nhe wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--\\nit seemed both.  its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the\\ntolling of a death knell.  he awaited each new stroke with impatience\\nand--he knew not why--apprehension.  the intervals of silence grew\\nprogressively longer; the delays became maddening.  with their greater\\ninfrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.  they hurt\\nhis ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek.  what he\\nheard was the ticking of his watch.\\n\\nhe unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.  \"if i could\\nfree my hands,\" he thought, \"i might throw off the noose and spring\\ninto the stream.  by diving i could evade the bullets and, swimming\\nvigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home.  my\\nhome, thank god, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little\\nones are still beyond the invader\\'s farthest advance.\"\\n\\nas these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were\\nflashed into the doomed man\\'s brain rather than evolved from it the\\ncaptain nodded to the sergeant.  the sergeant stepped aside.\\n\\n'"
